U.S. Senator Ben Sasse issued the following statement regarding the news that the administration will impose massive steel and aluminum tariffs on our allies in Canada, Mexico, and the European Union.

"This is dumb. Europe, Canada, and Mexico are not China, and you don’t treat allies the same way you treat opponents. We’ve been down this road before—blanket protectionism is a big part of why America had a Great Depression. 'Make America Great Again' shouldn’t mean 'Make America 1929 Again.'"
