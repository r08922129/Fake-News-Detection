The legislature of Washington State has met in special session and overwhelming voted to change the name of the State. Since George Washington owned Slaves, it is improper for this State to be named after him. Due to the great support provided to the cause of eliminating the history of slavery in the United States by George Soros, the Legislature of Washington has chosen the new name of Soros State. The change in name will take effect on November 1st, 2017 once the Governor of Washington signs the bill
