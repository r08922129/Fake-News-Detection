WESTERVILLE, Ohio  Like rival warships pulling into the same small harbor, Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton held rallies hours apart and exchanged oratorical barrages here Sunday.

Mr. Obama, of Illinois, struck at Mrs. Clinton’s claim to expertise in the arena of national security, saying she had one moment of transformative decision  Iraq  and she fumbled it.

“What precise foreign-policy experience is she claiming that makes her qualified to answer that telephone call at 3 a.m. in the morning?” Mr. Obama asked an audience of more than 3,000 in a high school gymnasium and overflow rooms here. “When it came to making the most important decision of our generation, Senator Clinton got it wrong.”

Mrs. Clinton’s take on Mr. Obama hours earlier was not much more forgiving. She again suggested that his speeches were empty and that the first-term senator was too green to occupy the Oval Office in a time of crisis.
