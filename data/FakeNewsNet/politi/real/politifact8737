For release 10:00 a.m. (ET) Thursday, March 11, 2021 USDL-21-0392 Technical information: (202) 691-5870 • JoltsInfo@bls.gov • www.bls.gov/jlt Media contact: (202) 691-5902 • PressOffice@bls.gov JOB OPENINGS AND LABOR TURNOVER – JANUARY 2021 The number of job openings changed little at 6.9 million on the last business day of January, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Hires were little changed at 5.3 million while total separations decreased to 5.3 million. Within separations, the quits rate and layoffs and discharges rate changed little at 2.3 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively. This release includes estimates of the number and rate of job openings, hires, and separations for the total nonfarm sector, by industry, and by four geographic regions. The release also includes 2020 annual estimates for hires and separations. The annual number of hires at 73.1 million and the annual number of layoffs and discharges at 41.0 million increased in 2020. The annual number of quits at 36.3 million decreased in 2020. Job Openings On the last business day of January, the number and rate of job openings were little changed at 6.9 million and 4.6 percent, respectively. Job openings increased in state and local government education (+56,000); educational services (+21,000); and mining and logging (+10,000). The number of job openings was little changed in all four regions. (See table 1.) Over the year, the number of job openings (not seasonally adjusted) was little changed in January. Job openings decreased in a number of industries over the year with the largest decreases in accommodation and food services; state and local government, excluding education; and arts, entertainment, and recreation. The job openings level increased over the year in nondurable goods manufacturing; durable goods manufacturing; and mining and logging. The number of job openings decreased in the West region. (See table 7.) __________________________________________________________________________________________________________ | Revisions to the JOLTS Estimates | | | |Job openings, hires, and separations have been revised to incorporate the annual updates to the Current | |Employment Statistics employment data and the JOLTS seasonal adjustment factors. See the revision | |section at the end of this release for more information. | |________________________________________________________________________________________________________| Hires In January, the number and rate of hires were little changed at 5.3 million and 3.7 percent, respectively. Hires increased in arts, entertainment, and recreation (+59,000) and in educational services (+25,000). Hires decreased in federal government (-15,000). The number of hires decreased in the South region. (See table 2.) The number of hires in January (not seasonally adjusted) decreased over the year (-696,000). Hires decreased in a number of industries with the largest decreases in accommodation and food services; professional and business services; and health care and social assistance. The number of hires decreased in the South and West regions. (See table 8.) Separations Total separations includes quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations. Quits are generally voluntary separations initiated by the employee. Therefore, the quits rate can serve as a measure of workers’ willingness or ability to leave jobs. Layoffs and discharges are involuntary separations initiated by the employer. Other separations includes separations due to retirement, death, disability, and transfers to other locations of the same firm. In January, the number of total separations decreased to 5.3 million (-275,000), and the total separations rate was little changed at 3.7 percent. The total separations level decreased in accommodation and food services (-242,000); educational services (-38,000); and state and local government education (-27,000). Total separations increased in transportation, warehousing, and utilities (+87,000) and in federal government (+9,000). Total separations were little changed in all four regions. (See table 3.) Over the year, the number of total separations (not seasonally adjusted) decreased (-403,000). Total separations decreased in a number of industries with the largest decreases in professional and business services; state and local government education; and educational services. Total separations increased in transportation, warehousing, and utilities and in federal government. The number of total separations decreased in the South and Midwest regions. (See table 9.) In January, the quits level and rate were little changed at 3.3 million and 2.3 percent, respectively. The number of quits increased in finance and insurance (+36,000) and in federal government (+5,000). The number of quits decreased in wholesale trade (-28,000); educational services (-18,000); and state and local government education (-14,000). The number of quits was little changed in all four regions. (See table 4.) Over the year, the number of quits (not seasonally adjusted) decreased (-239,000). Quits decreased in a number of industries with the largest decreases in professional and business services; state and local government education; and educational services. Quits increased in a number of industries with the largest increases in durable goods manufacturing; finance and insurance; and nondurable goods manufacturing. The number of quits decreased in the West region. (See table 10.) In January, the number and rate of layoffs and discharges were little changed at 1.7 million and 1.2 percent, respectively. The number of layoffs and discharges decreased in accommodation and food services (-209,000). The number of layoffs and discharges increased in transportation, warehousing, and utilities (+113,000) and in federal government (+5,000). Layoffs and discharges were little changed in all four regions. (See table 5.) Over the year, the layoffs and discharges level (not seasonally adjusted) was little changed. The number of layoffs and discharges decreased in a number of industries with the largest decreases in professional and business services; durable goods manufacturing; and finance and insurance. Layoffs and discharges increased in transportation, warehousing, and utilities; wholesale trade; and federal government. The number of layoffs and discharges increased in the West region but decreased in the Midwest region. (See table 11.) The number of other separations edged down in January to 310,000 (-42,000). Other separations decreased in a number of industries with the largest decreases in retail trade (-21,000); state and local government education (-9,000); and transportation, warehousing, and utilities (-8,000). Other separations increased in health care and social assistance (+17,000). The other separations level decreased in the South region but increased in the West region. (See table 6.) Over the year, the other separations level (not seasonally adjusted) decreased (-67,000). Other separations decreased in a number of industries with the largest decreases in retail trade; accommodation and food services; and state and local government education. The number of other separations increased in federal government. The number of other separations decreased in the South region. (See table 12.) Net Change in Employment Large numbers of hires and separations occur every month throughout the business cycle. Net employment change results from the relationship between hires and separations. When the number of hires exceeds the number of separations, employment rises, even if the hires level is steady or declining. Conversely, when the number of hires is less than the number of separations, employment declines, even if the hires level is steady or rising. Over the 12 months ending in January, hires totaled 72.4 million and separations totaled 81.2 million, yielding a net employment loss of 8.8 million. These totals include workers who may have been hired and separated more than once during the year. Annual Levels and Rates Consistent with BLS practice, annual estimates are published for not seasonally adjusted data and are published with the January news release each year. Annual estimates are not calculated for job openings because job openings are a stock, or point-in-time, measurement for the last business day of each month. Calculating annual levels and rates allows additional comparisons across years. Annual levels for hires, quits, layoffs and discharges, other separations, and total separations are the sum of the 12 revised monthly levels. Annual rates are computed by dividing the annual level by the Current Employment Statistics (CES) annual average employment level, and multiplying that quotient by 100. In 2020, there were 73.1 million hires, an increase of 3.1 million from 2019. Total separations increased by 13.5 million in 2020 to 81.5 million. Quits decreased for the first time in 11 years to 36.3 million in 2020, down by 5.8 million. Quits comprised 44.6 percent of total separations. Layoffs and discharges increased by 19.2 million in 2020 to 41.0 million and comprised 50.3 percent of total separations. Other separations increased by 162,000 in 2020 to 4.2 million and comprised 5.1 percent of total separations. These data reflect the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and efforts to contain it. (See tables 13 through 22.) The annual hires rate for 2020 was 51.4 percent of the annual average CES employment level. The annual total separations rate for 2020 was 57.3 percent. The annual rates for the components of total separations were 25.5 percent for quits, 28.8 percent for layoffs and discharges, and 2.9 percent for other separations. (See tables 13 through 22.) ____________ The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey estimates for February 2021 are scheduled to be released on Tuesday, April 6, 2021 at 10:00 a.m. (ET). __________________________________________________________________________________________________________ | Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic Impact on January 2021 Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey Data | | | |Data collection for the JOLTS survey was affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. While 42 | |percent of data are usually collected by phone at the JOLTS data collection center, most phone | |respondents were asked to report electronically. However, data collection was adversely impacted due to | |the inability to reach some respondents that normally respond by phone. The JOLTS response rate for | |January was 43 percent, while response rates prior to the pandemic averaged 54 percent. | |More information about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the JOLTS survey, including | |information about the JOLTS estimation methodology, is available at www.bls.gov/covid19/job- | |openings-and-labor-turnover-covid19-january-2021.htm. | |________________________________________________________________________________________________________| Table A.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (p) Preliminary NOTE: Data have been revised to incorporate the annual updates to the Current Employment Statistics employment estimates and the JOLTS seasonal adjustment factors. Revisions to Job Openings and Labor Turnover Data The JOLTS data are revised annually to reflect updates to the Current Employment Statistics (CES) employment estimates. The JOLTS employment levels (not published) are ratio-adjusted to the CES employment levels, and the resulting ratios are applied to all JOLTS data elements. This annual benchmarking process results in revisions to both the seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted JOLTS data series. The seasonally adjusted data are recalculated for the most recent 5 years in order to reflect updated seasonal adjustment factors. Further, the alignment methodology creates a dependency of the not seasonally adjusted estimates on the seasonal adjustment process. Therefore, the data series that are not seasonally adjusted are also recalculated for the most recent 5 years in order to reflect the effect of the updated seasonal adjustment factors on the alignment process. Tables B through G below present revised total nonfarm data for January through December 2020. The December 2020 revisions also reflect the routine incorporation of additional sample receipts into the final December estimates. Tables presenting revisions to total nonfarm data for January 2016 through December 2020 will be available on the JOLTS website later in the day following the release. The website also contains all revised seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted data. The revision tables and data can be accessed through the JOLTS homepage at www.bls.gov/jlt/. As of January 2021, all JOLTS data series will be seasonally adjusted. Not seasonally adjusted series that were previously designated as equal to the seasonally adjusted series have been revised back to December 2000. Table B.

Technical Note Special technical note: This technical note describes the procedures regularly used on a monthly basis to develop estimates from JOLTS survey responses. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the procedures described in this technical note have been modified. The modifications are briefly described in the box note in the news release and are described in more detail at www.bls.gov/covid19/effects-of-covid-19-pandemic-on-job-openings-and-labor-turnover-data.htm. This news release presents statistics from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). The JOLTS program provides information on labor demand and turnover. Additional information about the JOLTS program can be found at www.bls.gov/jlt/. Estimates are published for job openings, hires, quits, layoffs and discharges, other separations, and total separations. The JOLTS program covers all private nonfarm establishments, as well as federal, state, and local government entities in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Industries are classified in accordance with the North American Industry Classification System. Definitions Employment. Employment includes persons on the payroll who worked or received pay for the pay period that includes the 12th day of the reference month. Full-time, part-time, permanent, short-term, seasonal, salaried, and hourly employees are included, as are employees on paid vacation or other paid leave. Proprietors or partners of unincorporated businesses, unpaid family workers, or employees on strike for the entire pay period, and employees on leave without pay for the entire pay period are not counted as employed. Employees of temporary help agencies, employee leasing companies, outside contractors, and consultants are counted by their employer of record, not by the establishment where they are working. Job Openings. Job openings include all positions that are open on the last business day of the reference month. A job is open only if it meets all three of these conditions: * A specific position exists and there is work available for that position. The position can be full-time or part- time, and it can be permanent, short-term, or seasonal. * The job could start within 30 days, whether or not the employer can find a suitable candidate during that time. * The employer is actively recruiting workers from outside the establishment to fill the position. Active recruiting means that the establishment is taking steps to fill a position. It may include advertising in newspapers, on television, or on the radio; posting Internet notices, posting “help wanted” signs, networking or making “word-of-mouth” announcements; accepting applications; interviewing candidates; contacting employment agencies; or soliciting employees at job fairs, state or local employment offices, or similar sources. Excluded are positions open only to internal transfers, promotions or demotions, or recall from layoffs. Also excluded are openings for positions with start dates more than 30 days in the future, positions for which employees have been hired but the employees have not yet reported for work, and positions to be filled by employees of temporary help agencies, employee leasing companies, outside contractors, or consultants. The job openings rate is computed by dividing the number of job openings by the sum of employment and job openings and multiplying that quotient by 100. Hires. Hires include all additions to the payroll during the entire reference month, including newly hired and rehired employees; full-time and part-time employees; permanent, short-term, and seasonal employees; employees who were recalled to a job at the location following a layoff (formal suspension from pay status) lasting more than 7 days; on-call or intermittent employees who returned to work after having been formally separated; workers who were hired and separated during the month, and transfers from other locations. Excluded are transfers or promotions within the reporting location, employees returning from strike, employees of temporary help agencies, employee leasing companies, outside contractors, or consultants. The hires rate is computed by dividing the number of hires by employment and multiplying that quotient by 100. Separations. Separations include all separations from the payroll during the entire reference month and is reported by type of separation: quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations. Quits include employees who left voluntarily with the exception of retirements or transfers to other locations. Layoffs and discharges includes involuntary separations initiated by the employer including layoffs with no intent to rehire; layoffs (formal suspensions from pay status) lasting or expected to last more than 7 days; discharges resulting from mergers, downsizing, or closings; firings or other discharges for cause; terminations of permanent or short-term employees; and terminations of seasonal employees (whether or not they are expected to return the next season). Other separations include retirements, transfers to other locations, separations due to employee disability; and deaths. Excluded from separations are transfers within the same location; employees on strike; employees of temporary help agencies, employee leasing companies, outside contractors, or consultants. The separations rate is computed by dividing the number of separations by employment and multiplying that quotient by 100. The quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations rates are computed similarly. Estimation Method The JOLTS survey design is a stratified random sample of 20,700 nonfarm business and government establishments. The sample is stratified by ownership, region, industry sector, and establishment size class. The establishments are drawn from a universe of over 9.4 million establishments compiled by the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) program which includes all employers subject to state unemployment insurance laws and federal agencies subject to the Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program. Employment estimates are benchmarked, or ratio adjusted, monthly to the strike-adjusted employment estimates of the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey. A ratio of CES to JOLTS employment is used to adjust the levels for all other JOLTS data elements. Birth/death model. The time lag from the start up, or birth, of an establishment until its appearance on the sampling frame is approximately one year. Also within the first year, new businesses may go out of business, referred to as a death. Because not all births and deaths of establishments can be reflected on the sampling frame immediately, the JOLTS sample cannot capture job openings, hires, and separations from them during their early existence. BLS has developed a birth/death model that uses establishment birth and death activity from previous years. The estimates of job openings, hires, and separations produced by the birth/death model are added to the sample-based estimates produced from the survey to arrive at the estimates for job openings, hires, and separations. Alignment. The JOLTS figure for hires minus separations can be used to derive a measure of net employment change. This change should be comparable to the net employment change from the much larger CES survey. However, definitional differences as well as sampling and non- sampling errors between the two surveys historically caused JOLTS to diverge from CES over time. To limit the divergence, and improve the quality of the JOLTS hires and separations series, BLS implemented the monthly alignment method. There are four steps to this method: seasonally adjust, align, back out the seasonal adjustment factors, and re-seasonally adjust. Seasonal adjustment. BLS uses X-13 ARIMA for seasonal adjustment. A concurrent seasonal adjustment methodology is used in which new seasonal adjustment factors are calculated each month, using all relevant data, up to and including current month data. JOLTS seasonal adjustment includes both additive and multiplicative models and REGARIMA (regression with auto-correlated errors) modeling to improve the seasonal adjustment factors at the beginning and end of the series and to detect and adjust for outliers in the series. The seasonally adjusted CES employment trends are applied to the seasonally adjusted JOLTS implied employment trends (hires minus separations) forcing them to be approximately the same, while preserving the seasonality of the JOLTS data. Annual estimates. The JOLTS estimates are revised annually to reflect annual updates to the CES employment estimates and the JOLTS seasonal adjustment factors. The JOLTS employment levels (not published) are ratio- adjusted to the CES employment levels, and the resulting ratios are applied to all JOLTS data elements. The seasonally adjusted data are recalculated for the most recent 5 years in order to reflect updated seasonal adjustment factors. These annual updates result in revisions to both the seasonally adjusted and not seasonally adjusted JOLTS data series, for the period since the last benchmark was established. Annual levels for hires, quits, layoffs and discharges, other separations, and total separations are the sum of the 12 published monthly levels. Annual rates are computed by dividing the annual level by the Current Employment Statistics (CES) annual average employment level, and multiplying that quotient by 100. This figure will be approximately equal to the sum of the 12 monthly rates. Consistent with BLS practice, annual estimates are published only for not seasonally adjusted data and are released with the January news release each year. Annual estimates are not calculated for job openings because job openings are a stock, or point-in-time, measurement for the last business day of each month. Reliability of the estimates JOLTS estimates are subject to both sampling and nonsampling error. Nonsampling error occurs when a sample is surveyed rather than the entire population. There is a chance that the sample estimates may differ from the true population values they represent. The difference, or sampling error, varies depending on the particular sample selected. This variability is measured by the standard error of the estimate. BLS analysis is generally conducted at the 90-percent level of confidence. That means that there is a 90-percent chance, or level of confidence, that an estimate based on a sample will differ by no more than 1.6 standard errors from the true population value because of sampling error. Sampling error estimates are available at www.bls.gov/jlt/jolts_median_standard_errors.htm. The JOLTS estimates also are affected by nonsampling error. Nonsampling error can occur for many reasons including: the failure to include a segment of the population; the inability to obtain data from all units in the sample; the inability or unwillingness of respondents to provide data on a timely basis; mistakes made by respondents; errors made in the collection or processing of the data; and errors from the employment benchmark data used in estimation.
